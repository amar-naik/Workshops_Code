This is crucial for LLMs, which often deal with nuanced language and require understanding context and intent.\n","\n","> **Scalability**: Vector databases are designed to scale effectively with large datasets of LLM outputs and prompts, making them suitable for complex real-world applications.\n","\n","### Must Visit Links for Quickly Learning about Vector DB\n","\n","https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/vector-databases-a-beginners-guide-b050cbbe9ca0\n","\n","\n","### Additional Resource link for Vector DB\n","Vector databases use special search techniques known as Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, which includes methods like hashing and graph-based searches.\n","\n","Read more here :\n","https://www.datacamp.com/blog/the-top-5-vector-databases\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"USJ9gAtwRYpL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"gmN4A2fGSkpl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"google":{"image_path":"/site-assets/images/share.png","keywords":["examples","googleai","samplecode","python","embed"]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
